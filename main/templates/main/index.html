                <p>Hey!—</p>
                <p>
                    Are you interested in Sci-Hub? We’re interested in
                    <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Sci-Hub</span>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re a group of people (not affiliated with Sci-Hub) that
                    wants to talk about and exchange ideas and stories about the
                    unique library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re new and we’ll have our first meetup around Fall 2021
                    at <a href="https://www.nwspk.com/">Newspeak House</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    PS. We do not support, endorse, or contribute in any
                    way to illegal activities. Our interest to Sci-Hub is only
                    from a societal and research point of view.

                <h2>Sci-Hub can be approached through many lenses</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Practical.</span>
                    Making it easier to download articles, even when one has
                    access through the official channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Essential.</span>
                    Without Sci-Hub lots of people (and especially those from
                    poor countries/universities) would not be able to access a
                    wide array papers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Ethical.</span>
                    Neither does one want to be treated unfairly nor wrong
                    someone else. Is it fair for Sci-Hub to exist?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Political.</span>
                    In addition to everything else, it was our societies’ laws
                    that motivated Sci-Hub to come to existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Technical.</span>
                    How on earth does all this bandwidth demand from
                    all over the world get covered?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Legal.</span>
                    What do copyright laws say and how are they defined?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="landing-wordgram">Research.</span>
                    Does more people having access to research papers lead
                    to science speeding up?
                </p>
                <p>...and many more we haven’t thought yet.</p>

                <p>

                    above, join us—we’d love to hear them.

        <p>Hey!—</p>
        <p>
            Are you interested in Sci-Hub? We’re interested in
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Sci-Hub</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re a group of people (not affiliated with Sci-Hub) that
            wants to talk about and exchange ideas and stories about the
            unique library.
        </p>

        <p>
            We had our first meetup in September 2021 at
            <a href="https://www.nwspk.com/">Newspeak House</a>, and it was great!
            You can find our discussion notes
            <a href="/meetup-1/#notes">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            PS. We do not support, endorse, or contribute in any
            way to illegal activities. Our interest to Sci-Hub is only
            from a societal and research point of view.

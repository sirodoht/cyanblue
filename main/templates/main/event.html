    <article class="intro">
        <p>Hey!—</p>
        <p>
            Are you interested in Sci-Hub? We’re interested in
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Sci-Hub</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re a group of people (not affiliated with Sci-Hub) that
            wants to talk about and exchange ideas and stories about the
            unique library.
        </p>

        <p>
            Join us in our inaugural meetup at Newspeak House. Let’s meetup and
            talk about the phenomenon of
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Sci-Hub</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Context for the current affairs: Sci-Hub has been under attack since
            its inception, but since February 2021, it has stopped getting updated.
            No new articles are added. This is due an ongoing legal hearing in
            India, which keeps—constantly—being
            <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/lofj0r/announcement_scihub_has_been_paused_no_new/">postponed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Update 5/11/2021:</em>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/ringo_ring/status/1434356217208623106">Sci-Hub adds 2m new articles</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sci-Hub has a large impact to researchers from all disciplines, students,
            activists, copyright pirates, politicians, law people, and eventually the whole
            of society. This is the reason that we expect people from various different
            fields of interest to join.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is also the reason that even if one feels they are from a completely
            irrelevant area and are not sure if they should attend, the answer is
            definitely yes! I’m pretty confident everyone can fit it and talk about
            Sci-Hub.
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of agenda, there will be a short presentation about the latest
            developments around Sci-Hub and then various discussions around
            Sci-Hub, ethical concerns, social impact, et al.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hope to see you there :)

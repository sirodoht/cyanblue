    <article class="intro">
        <p>Hey!—</p>
        <p>
            Are you interested in Sci-Hub? We’re interested in
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Sci-Hub</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re a group of people (not affiliated with Sci-Hub) that
            wants to talk about and exchange ideas and stories about the
            unique library.
        </p>

        <p>
            Join us in our inaugural meetup at Newspeak House. Let’s meetup and
            talk about the phenomenon of
            <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Sci-Hub</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Context for the current affairs: Sci-Hub has been under attack since
            its inception, but since February 2021, it has stopped getting updated.
            No new articles are added. This is due an ongoing legal hearing in
            India, which keeps—constantly—being
            <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/lofj0r/announcement_scihub_has_been_paused_no_new/">postponed</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It will be interesting to see what impact this will have in the
            research community, as people already cannot find new papers. Will
            research slow down?
        </p>
        <p>
            This is some of the content our discussions can have in this first
            meetup. There is no RSVP, just show up!
        </p>

        <h2>Sci-Hub can be approached through many lenses</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Practical.</span>
            Making it easier to download articles, even when one has
            access through the official channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Essential.</span>
            Without Sci-Hub lots of people (and especially those from
            poor countries/universities) would not be able to access a
            wide array papers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Ethical.</span>
            Neither does one want to be treated unfairly nor wrong
            someone else. Is it fair for Sci-Hub to exist?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Political.</span>
            In addition to everything else, it was our societies’ laws
            that motivated Sci-Hub to come to existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Technical.</span>
            How on earth does all this bandwidth demand from
            all over the world get covered?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Legal.</span>
            What do copyright laws say and how are they defined?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="wordgram">Research.</span>
            Does more people having access to research papers lead
            to science speeding up?
        </p>
        <p>...and many more we haven’t thought yet.</p>

        <p>
            If you have any thoughts or comments on the
            above, join us—we’d love to hear them.
